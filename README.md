## 📂 Repository Structure

- [`src/`](src/) — All C source code files for logic-building, DSA, and algorithm exercises.
- [`docs/`](docs/) — Course notes, templates, and additional documentation.
- [`bin/`](bin/) — Compiled binaries (created by the build process, not tracked in git).
- [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) — GitHub Actions workflows for automated CI builds.
- [`.vscode/`](.vscode/) — Visual Studio Code configuration for debugging and development.
- [`organize_repo.bat`](organize_repo.bat) — Script to organize and clean up the repository.
- [`setup_repo.bat`](setup_repo.bat) — Script to initialize all standard files and folders.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC or any C/C++ compiler
- Java JDK (for Java programs)
- `make` (optional, for build automation)
- Visual Studio Code (optional, for development and debugging)

### Build All C Programs

```sh
make
```

This will compile all `.c` files in [`src/`](src/) and place the executables in [`bin/`](bin/).

### Run an Example

```sh
./bin/program01
```
Replace `program01` with the desired program name.
